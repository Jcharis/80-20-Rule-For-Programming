## 80/20 Rule For Learning and Mastering Programming
+ Using Programming Languages as a tool to solve problems and inspire people.
+ Learn enough code to create products and tools.
+ Don't just code create.
+ Programming is problem finding and solving before coding.
+ Not everything can be solved with programming hence think first and see if there is an alternative before programming


#### FunFact
+ 20% of product features are used by majority of the people ie the 80% of users
+ 20% of bugs are responsible for 80% of the issues
+ 80% of internet traffic is used on 20% of websites [Google,Email,Facebook/Instagram/Whatsapp,Youtube,Github,Stackoverflow,Twitter,PH]
+ 80% of programming languages are in English.
+ 80% of websites are being hosted in a few locations from where it was made.
+ Simplicity beats complexity

 - 80%/20% is an approximation
